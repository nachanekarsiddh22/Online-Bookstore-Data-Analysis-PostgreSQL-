**Project Overview**

Performed end-to-end data analysis on an Online Bookstore using PostgreSQL. Queries were designed to explore book availability, genre analysis, customer purchasing behavior, total revenue generation, top titles, and high-value customers. Advanced insights were generated through grouping, joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions, helping understand author performance, frequently ordered books, city-level spending, and sales patterns. This project demonstrates practical SQL skills applicable to real-world business scenarios.
